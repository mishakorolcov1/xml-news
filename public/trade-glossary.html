                which can be seized if the debtor defaults. ABS are created by the process of securitization whereby
                banks
                pool types of loans and use them as collateral or security against a bond issue.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Accrued Interest</b>
            <p class=" wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s" >Accrued interest is the interest accruing on a security since the previous coupon date. If a security is
                sold
                between two payment dates, the buyer usually compensates the seller for the interest accrued, either
                within
                the price or as a separate payment.</p>
            <b class=" wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s" >Amortization</b>

            <p class=" wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s" >An annualized rate plots the change in an indicator over the whole year if the latest monthly or
                quarterly
                figure is presumed to persist for the rest of the year. It is calculated by multiplying one month’s
                change
                by 12 to produce the annualized rate, or one quarter’s rate by four.</p>
            <b class=" wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s" >Arbitrage</b>
            <p class=" wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s" >Arbitrage is the process of buying and selling an identical (or very similar) financial instrument at the
                same time on different markets. True arbitrage requires that the financial instrument is trading at two
                different prices, and that the buying and selling trades can be completed at the same time.</p>
            <b class=" wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s" >At-the-Money</b>
            <p class=" wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s" >An option is described as being at-the-money when the exercise price is approximately the same as that of

            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">A bar chart is a type of chart that is used frequently by technical
                analysts and traders. Price data is represented on a vertical bar. The top of the bar is the highest
                price and the bottom of the bar the lowest. A dash on the left-hand side of the bar denotes the opening
                price, while conversely a dash on the right-hand side the closing price.</p>

                overnight deposits which Nexus Trade uses as a basis for determining the rates at which we pay (i.e.,
                benchmark less a spread) and charge (i.e., benchmark plus a spread) interest to client accounts It’s
                important to note that each available currency is assigned a unique Benchmark Rate and that Benchmark
                Rates are subject to change on a daily basis.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Bid-Ask Quote</b>
            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">A two-way price comprises a bid, or the price at which a dealer is
                willing to buy, and an ask (or offer) at which a dealer is willing to sell. The bid, by definition, is
                always below the ask and is always the first quoted price. The difference between the two quotes is
                known as the spread.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Bill; T-Bill</b>
            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">A bill is a short-term debt instrument with a maturity usually no longer

                government debt.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Bond Equivalent Yield</b>
            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Bond equivalent yield is a calculation that converts the yield of a money
                market instrument, such as a treasury bill, into the equivalent yield of a treasury bond in order to
                compare efficiency.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Bull Market</b>

            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">The purchase by a company of its own shares in the open market, usually
                based on the belief that the shares are undervalued and that buying them will provide a better
                investment return than using the cash for the underlying business of the company. In theory the buy back
                will reduce the number of shares in the market and increase the value of the remaining ones. This
                process is also known as a share repurchase. It effectively returns to the shareholders the cash held in
                company reserves which already belongs to them.</p>

                analysts. Candlesticks capture the same price information as a bar chart: the open, high, low and close.
                A thick box (known as the body of the candle) joins the open and close values. Thin lines on either end
                of the body (known as shadows) join the high and low prices. If the open value is higher than the close
                value, the body of the candle is solid or colored. Conversely, if the close is higher than the open then
                the body of the candle is clear, white or unshaded.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Cash Dividend</b>

                calculated by collecting and comparing the prices of a set basket of goods and services, as bought by a
                typical consumer, at regular intervals over time. Also known as Retail Price Index.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Crack Spread</b>

                exchanged. Often, one party will pay a fixed interest rate, while another will pay a floating exchange
                rate (though there may also be fixed-fixed and floating-floating arrangements). At the maturity of the
                swap, the principal amounts are exchanged back. Unlike an interest rate swap, the principal and interest
                are both exchanged in full in a currency swap</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Current Excess Liquidity</b>

            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Devaluation is the formal downward adjustment of a currency’s official
                par value or central exchange rate. An example would be the Chinese Renmimbi, which is pegged to a
                basket of international currencies. Chinese government officials will devalue or revalue their currency
                based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the basket of currencies to which the Renmimbi is
                pegged.</p>
            <b class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Direct Rollover</b>
            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Refers to the movement of assets into an IRA from an employer-sponsored

            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">There are two types of dividends a company can issue: cash and stock
                dividends. Typically only one or the other is issued at a specific period of time (either quarterly,
                bi-annually or yearly) but both may occur simultaneously. In the case of a cash dividend, a certain
                amount of money is distributed to each shareholder (e.g., in the case of cash dividend of $0.25 per
                share, the owner of 100 shares would receive $25 in total). As cash dividends are normally paid to
                stockholders out of the corporation’s current earnings or accumulated profits their effect is to reduce
                the equity of the company once issued.</p>

                An acquisition, also known as a takeover or a buyout, is the buying of one company (the ‘target’) by

                target company or through the purchase of the assets of the target company. In this instance, the cash
                the target receives from the sell-off is paid back to its shareholders by dividend or through
                liquidation. Acquisitions can often be friendly but also hostile, meaning that the acquired company does

            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Quantitative analysis is the statistical analysis of data to determine
                the value of a security. Revenues, earnings, margins and market share are among the aspects examined. A
                portfolio of shares might be constructed using statistical analysis of historic returns, price
                volatility and price correlations of different assets. QA relies heavily on mathematical models such as
                the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the dividend discount model (DDM).</p>

            <p data-localize="glossary.text82">This is a Traditional IRA that only holds assets received as a rollover
                distribution from a retirement plan. U.S. securities firms may permit investors to sub-classify a
                Traditional IRA as a Rollover IRA. This classification helps the customer identify the assets as a
                rollover from a retirement plan.<br>
                Rollover IRAs are often used when an individual receives a lump sum distribution from an employer
                sponsored retirement plan (e.g. 401(k) or 403(b)) and wants to continue the tax-deferred growth of those

            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">The creation of asset-backed securities (ABS). The assets to be
                securitized are sold to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), thus isolating the borrower from any claims for
                repayment. The SPV then issues bonds or other debt instruments which can be traded. The money raised by
                the issuance of the debt is used to pay the borrower for the assets. Mortgages are one example of a
                security which can be securitized.</p>

                payment currency) is the second currency listed in the currency pair description (example: EUR.USD). The
                transaction currency multiplied by the exchange rate will indicate the settlement currency amount for
                the transaction. For example, an order to buy 100,000 EUR.USD @ 1.353 has a settlement currency amount

            <p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">A type of corporate action that increases a company’s number of
                outstanding shares by dividing each share, which in turn diminishes its price. In the case of a 2-for-1
                (2:1) stock split, for example, the company will distribute an additional share for every one
                outstanding share, so the total shares outstanding will double A split can also be referred to in
                percentage terms. Thus, a 2 for 1 (2:1) split can also be termed a stock split of 100%. A 3 for 2 split
                (3:2) would be a 50% split.</p>

                increments. Each 0.25 is one tick.<br>
                The tick value is the cash value of one tick (one minimum price movement). For example, again using the
                ES futures, each 0.25 is valued at USD 12.50. So the tick value for the ES futures is USD 12.50.</p>
