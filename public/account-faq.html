             <p class="mt-5">You are requested to give the following information for proof of identity upon registration:</p>
             <p class="mt-5">Proof of ID. A copy of your Passport, National ID or Driver’s License </p>
             <p class="mt-5">A copy of a utility bill or bank statement, not older than 3 months </p>
             <p class="mt-5">You will need to clearly indicate the beneficiary name on the Konyax   Client Agreement. It is important that the account beneficiary name corresponds to the name on the client agreement form, and also the documents for proof of identity.

             <h5 class="mt-4"><b>How do you manage your risk?</b></h5>
             <p class="mt-4">The stop-loss order and the limit order are the most common risk management tools in Forex trading. A limit order sets a restriction on the minimum price to be received or the maximum price to be paid. An automatic liquidation at a predetermined price for a particular position is called a stop loss. This is used to limit potential losses if the market <br>moves against an investor’s position.</p>
